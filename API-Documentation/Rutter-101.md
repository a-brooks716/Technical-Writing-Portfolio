## Introduction
Rutter is a Universal API for B2B financial products (Fintech/ Banks/ Financial institutions). And while I am not writing this documentation as the original author, I will be 're-documenting' it as an excercise and practice for future projects. 

## Who is Rutter
Rutter acts like a golden key for integrations in the financial technology (fintech) world. They offer specialized APIs (Universal/Unified APIs) that allow fintech companies to connect seamlessly with various banking platforms.

Imagine QuickBooks, one of the most popular accounting software used by small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Despite its popularity, not every product on the market can easily integrate with QuickBooks. Only a select few can afford to do so, making it seem like you need to be one of the "cool kids" to join the club.

Rutter changes this by providing the tools needed to integrate with these major platforms, making it accessible even for smaller companies that might not have the resources to build these integrations on their own. With Rutter, fintech companies can connect with multiple banking and financial platforms through a single, unified API, simplifying the process and expanding their reach.

## Rutter In Action
Below I'm going to showcase an example of putting Rutter's API to use through a fictional company and situation.
### Situation
Meet EcoSupply Co., a small but rapidly growing company that specializes in supplying eco-friendly office products to businesses. EcoSupply Co. has built a strong reputation for its sustainable products and excellent customer service. As their customer base grew, so did their financial management needs. They were using multiple banking platforms and accounting software to manage their finances, which became increasingly complex and time-consuming.

### Problem
EcoSupply Co. faced several challenges:

1. Integration Issues: The various banking platforms and accounting software they used did not integrate well with each other. This caused data silos and inconsistencies, making it difficult to get a unified view of their financial health.
2. Manual Data Entry: Employees had to manually enter financial data from one platform to another, leading to errors and inefficiencies.
3. Lack of Real-Time Data: The manual processes meant that financial data was often outdated, preventing timely decision-making.

### Solution -> Rutter

EcoSupply Co. decided to implement Rutter's Universal API to streamline their financial management processes. Here's how Rutter's API helped solve their problems:
1. Seamless Integration: Rutter's API provided a single point of integration for all their banking platforms and accounting software. This allowed EcoSupply Co. to automatically sync financial data across all systems, eliminating data silos and inconsistencies.
